# PDF Form ADT-1 Extractor

This project extracts information from a PDF of Form ADT-1, which is used for auditor appointments in India. It uses OCR to read the PDF, extracts key information using regular expressions, and then uses a local AI model via Ollama to generate a summary of the extracted data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Tesseract-OCR:** This is required for the OCR functionality. You can download and install it from the [official Tesseract repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
*   **Ollama:** A running instance of Ollama with a suitable model (e.g., `llama3.2`, `llama3`, `llama2`, or `mistral`). You can find installation instructions on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
    ```
    Then, install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Tesseract Path:**
    Open the `extractor.py` file and update the Tesseract command path if you installed it in a different location:
    ```python
    # Line 10 in extractor.py
    pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
    ```

4.  **Ensure Ollama is running:**
    Make sure your Ollama application is running and has downloaded a model that the script can use. The script will try to use `llama3.2` by default but will look for other models if it's not available.

## Usage

1.  **Place your PDF file:**
    Put the Form ADT-1 PDF file in the root directory of the project and make sure it is named `Form ADT-1-29092023_signed.pdf`, or update the `pdf_path` variable in the `main` function in `extractor.py`.

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python extractor.py
    ```

## Output

The script will generate two files:

*   `output.json`: Contains the structured data extracted from the PDF.
*   `summary.txt`: Contains a 3-4 line summary of the extracted data, generated by Ollama.

The extracted data will also be printed to the console upon completion.
